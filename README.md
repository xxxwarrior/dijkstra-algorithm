# dijkstra-python
dijkstra implementation which shows the exact path 

This is a simple dijkstra algorithm implementation. 
It counts the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph.
It returns the actual path from the starting node to the end.

For now works only for valid values (i.e. there IS a possible way between the nodes).
